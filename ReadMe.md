Selection of EU-HYDI data for publication and export to csv.

EU-HYDI stands for the [EUropean HYdrological Data Inventory]. It is a dataset of soil hydrological, physical and chemical properties assembled in 2013 in the context of EU FP7 project My Water. It contains data from more than 18000 soil samples contributed by 27 institutions in Europe. The compilation work was led by MÃ©lanie Weynants at the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (JRC).

Some contributors but not all have agreed to make their data publicly accessible through the European Soil Data Centre of the JRC. This repository contains the R code to filter the original dataset and extract the data that may be distributed to a set of csv files.
